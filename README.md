# Banking_Application
This Java program, named "Banking," simulates a basic banking system through the command line interface. It creates a BankAccount class to manage account-related operations. Upon execution, the main method initializes a BankAccount instance and presents a menu to the user, allowing them to interact with their account. The user can check their balance (A), deposit money (B), withdraw money (C), view previous transaction details (D), calculate fixed deposit interest (E), calculate savings account interest (F), and exit the program (Q). The program ensures PIN validation for withdrawals and calculates interest for fixed and savings accounts. The user can perform these actions until choosing to exit.
